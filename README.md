### 🍀 About Me 👋



🧬 I am [Molena](https://thmolena.github.io/molena/).I am a Third-year Applied Mathematics Ph.D. Student at North Carolina State University (Raleigh, North Carolina, USA). I am currently developing efficient algorithms in Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra for kernel matrix approximation on GPU–Accelerated Computing and Parallel Computing, with applications in Scientific Computing, and High Performance Computing, including, but not limited to Hierarchical matrices, Low–Rank and Rank Structured matrices, Hierarchically Off–Diagonal Low–Rank matrices, and Hierarchically Semi–Separable matrices, in addition to the applications to kernel methods in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Data Science.

🎓 In May of 2023, I received the degree of Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from North Carolina State University. I also successfully passed my Ph.D. Written Qualifying Examination in Matrix Theory, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, and Lie Algebra.

</li>
<br>

🎯 During my lab rotation in the Spring semester of 2023 and Summer of 2023, I worked on the applications of Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Dimensionality Reduction and Topological Data Analysis in Computational Biology and Single cell Biology. Specifically, I was solving metric learning, data alignment, data integration, and trajectory inference problems for Spatial Transcriptomics, Single-cell Transcriptomics, Single-cell Multi-omics, and Single-cell Genomic Data.

📈 During the Summer of 2022, I completed two Computer Science Graduate Summer Research Internships. My first internship was in Time Series, Demand Forecasting with Uncertainty Quantification, Bertrand Competition, Payment Channel Network. My second internship was in Spatio–temporal Graph Neural Networks, Time Series, Demand Forecasting and Clustering, Optimization for Linear–Quadratic Differential Games.

📊 During my lab rotation in the Spring and Fall semester of 2022, I worked on designing novel Spatio–Temporal Unsupervised Learning algorithms with an application on County–level Colorectal Cancer Incidence Data.

### ⌛️ Outreach Activities
✨ I have served as a Society of Industrial & Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Officer at the Society of Industrial & Applied Mathematics North Carolina State University Chapter for two years (2022-2024). In January of 2022, I was a project mentor at the "Tenth Annual Conference to Increase Diversity in Mathematical Modeling and Public Health" (2022 MIDAS-CCDD), which was hosted by the MIDAS Coordination Center in cooperation with the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics (CCDD) at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. In October of 2021, I was a conference moderator at the Graduates Achieving Inclusion Now (GAIN) Conference on measuring graduate students' success, allyship, and mentorship.

### 🧸 Fun Fact
💭 At the age of 20, with several acceptance letters and full scholarships from different prestigious Mathematics and Applied Mathematics PhD programs for the Fall semester of 2021, I was honored to officially become an incoming first-year Applied Mathematics PhD student at North Carolina State University (starting in the Fall semester of 2021). During the Spring semester of 2021, I participated in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program to prepare me for a smooth transition from a rural and relatively small 4-year Liberal Arts College to the prestigious Applied Mathematics PhD Program. 

In the Fall semester of 2018, right after receiving a High School Diploma, I attended a rural and relatively small 4-year Liberal Arts College in Kentucky (Berea College). In fewer than three years, from the starting point of 0 transfer credit, after changing my major(s) for four times, I graduated from Berea College with a MAGNA CUM LAUDE Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics (with a Computer Science minor), with a Major GPA of 4.0/ 4.0.

In just 4 semesters of college, I completed several Directed Studies in Mathematics, and every single one of the upper-level Mathematics courses that Berea College offered with only A's and A+'s. In the past 5 semesters, I had to fill in the overload coursework form in every single semester to take 6 full-credit courses, as all Berea College students are only allowed to self-register for 4 full-credit courses per semester.
